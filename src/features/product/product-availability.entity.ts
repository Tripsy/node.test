/**
 * Recurring windows in which the product may be ordered - a lunch menu on weekdays between 12:00
 * and 15:00, a happy hour every evening.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `product.available_from` / `available_until`, which answer a
 * different question. Those are absolute and describe the product's life in the catalog: when it
 * first appears and when it is withdrawn, and they alone drive `sale_status`. These rows describe
 * the hours *within* that life when ordering is open, repeat forever, and leave `sale_status`
 * untouched - an out-of-hours product is still `available`, just not right now.
 *
 * A window is a weekday and, optionally, a span of clock times - no hours at all means the whole
 * of that day. Bounding the recurrence itself - a list that runs daily but only over the summer -
 * is the product's own life in the catalog, so it belongs on those absolute dates rather than
 * being expressed a second time here where it would not reach `sale_status`.
 *
 * **No row means always available.** The absence of a restriction is the common case and should
 * not require one row per weekday to express.
