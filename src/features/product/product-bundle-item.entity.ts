/**
 * A component of a bundle: the cheeseburger that is part of the burger menu. `product_id` names
 * the bundle it belongs to, and `group_id` the choice it is a candidate for, if any.
 *
 * A row is one of three things, and the two flags read against `group_id` rather than on their
 * own:
 *
 * 1. **Always included** - no group, `is_optional = false`. Part of the kit, covered by the
 *    bundle's own price.
 * 2. **An independent tick box** - no group, `is_optional = true`. The customer takes none to
 *    `quantity` of it, bounded by nothing else.
 * 3. **A candidate** - `group_id` set. The group decides how many of its candidates are taken,
 *    so `is_optional` is meaningless here and refused: the row is neither always included nor
 *    free to be taken on its own terms.
 *
 * Taking a component under 2 or 3 adds `variant.sale_price + price_delta` per unit, where the
 * delta is the per-currency figure in `product_bundle_item_price`. One meaning in both cases: it
 * adjusts the component's own price, never the bundle's. Making a candidate free therefore means
 * a delta of its whole price, not zero.
 *
 * `quantity` is a **ceiling** on 2 alone - the most the customer may take of that tick box - and a
 * plain count on 1 and 3. A candidate is not a ceiling: its group decides *which* candidate is
 * taken, never how many of it, so the figure is what the bundle contains once that candidate is
 * the one chosen. See `.claude/rules/product.md` §8.
 *
 * Distinct from `product_option`, which `product_bundle_group` otherwise mirrors: an option's
 * answer is a label with a delta and nothing behind it, where a candidate here is a variant, so it
 * consumes stock.
 *
 * `variant_id` points at what is actually consumed, so stock, VAT class and cost all come from the
 * component rather than the bundle.
