/**
 * A choice offered inside a bundle — "choose your fries" — whose candidates are the
 * `product_bundle_item` rows carrying its `group_id`. Exactly one of them is taken.
 *
 * This is the only thing in the schema that says **exactly one of these**. An optional component
 * outside a group is an independent tick box bounded by nothing but its own `quantity`, so two of
 * them can both be taken or both left.
 *
 * **No `min_select` / `max_select`, unlike `product_option_group`**, and this is the one place the
 * two shapes deliberately diverge. Such a bound would count candidate *rows*, while what a bundle
 * is measured in is units — every candidate carries its own `quantity` ceiling. So the one case
 * the pair would buy, a mixed pack of *n* units drawn from a list, is exactly the case it cannot
 * state: `max_select = 6` over rows whose ceiling is 2 permits twelve. Rather than keep two
 * columns nothing could read correctly, a bundle choice means one thing and says it in its shape.
 *
 * A group therefore needs **two** candidates to be a choice at all —
 * `ProductService.assertBundleGroupsAreUsable` refuses fewer. With one, "exactly one of these" is
 * just a component that is always included, wearing a prompt.
 *
 * Distinct from `product_option_group` in what a candidate is, too: an option's answer is a term —
 * a label with a delta and nothing behind it — where a candidate here is a variant, so the choice
 * decides what leaves stock and at which VAT rate. See `.claude/rules/product.md` §8.
