	 * A numeric term is an id lookup; anything else searches the translation and the codes.
	 *
	 * The full-text branch requires the `content` alias to be joined by the caller, and the
	 * expression must stay character-identical to the GIN index in
	 * `1788300000000-product-content-search.ts` — Postgres only uses an expression index when
	 * the query repeats it verbatim, and a mismatch degrades to a sequential scan with nothing
	 * reported. The same holds for the code branch and
	 * `IDX_product_variant_sku_prefix`: it is `lower(sku) LIKE lower(:term)` and not `ILIKE`,
	 * because `ILIKE` cannot use that index at all.
	 *
	 * A code is looked up as often as a name, so the variant SKUs are checked alongside — as a
	 * prefix match rather than part of the tsvector, since a SKU is one token with punctuation
	 * in it that the `simple` configuration would split apart.
	 *
	 * The subquery is what makes it correct rather than the `variant` alias the listings already
	 * join: that join is pinned to `is_default = true`, so reusing it would silently fail to
	 * find a product by any code but its default one.

	/**
	 * What a storefront may show: finished, past its opening date, inside its selling window and
	 * not withdrawn.
	 *
	 * **Derived from the timestamps, never from `sale_status`.** That column is a projection
	 * `recompute-product-sale-status.cron.ts` catches up on a schedule, so reading it here would
	 * hide a product until the pass after its window opened and keep selling one until the pass
	 * after it closed. All three deadlines are therefore compared directly, `discontinued_at`
	 * included — a withdrawal scheduled for a future date is the one the other two clauses say
	 * nothing about.
	 *
	 * `workflow` is the one condition no timestamp implies. A product nobody ever published has no
	 * dates set, so every deadline clause passes and it would be public; the workflow clause is
	 * what keeps a draft out.
	 *
	 * `product_availability` is *not* consulted. Those are recurring windows within the product's
	 * life and leave `sale_status` untouched — an out-of-hours dish is still listed, it just
	 * cannot be ordered right now. See `.claude/rules/product.md` §9.
	 *
	 * The filter is tri-state, so the guard tests for an absent value rather than a falsy one:
	 * `false` is the dashboard's "Not sellable" and asks for the complement, which a falsy check
	 * would answer with the whole catalog. The whole predicate is negated rather than each half,
	 * and it is one `filterRaw` for that reason — every clause resolves to true or false (the
	 * `IS NULL` branches make sure of it, and `workflow` is not nullable), so `NOT` cannot lose a
	 * row to three-valued logic.
