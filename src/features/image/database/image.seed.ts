 * Cover art for the public site: article covers, product covers, and the per-variant galleries
 * a catalog listing variants draws from.
 *
 * Only the rows are seeded here — the bytes live in the **frontend** container, under
 * `nready-ui/public/uploads/`, because `IMAGE_SAVE_PATH` is a frontend setting and the UI is
 * what writes and serves uploads. `nready-ui/.claude/scripts/fetch-seed-images.sh` fetches
 * files for exactly the paths below; a row without its file renders as a broken image, so
 * run the two together.
 *
 * Deliberately partial, and that is the point rather than a shortcut. The storefront resolves a
 * card's picture through a fallback chain — a variant's own gallery, then its product's, and a
 * collapsed card the other way round — so seeding everything would leave every branch but the
 * first untested. Covering two products in three and one variant in three means one pass over
 * the catalog shows all of it: products with art, products falling back to their default
 * variant, variants with their own photograph, variants borrowing their product's, and cards
 * with no image at all.
